# plotwise

This tiny script creates pie diagrams out of exported [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/) data. 
It was originally coded in order to have an overview of how much money i've spent on vacation for 
each category (Hotel, Transportation, Food, etc.).

F\*ck it, ship it.

## Usage

Simply download the code and append the file with ```-f <yourfile>``` like so:

```bash
$ plotwise.py -f <path-to-your-file>
```
